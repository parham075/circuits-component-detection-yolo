# Formalization of circuits made of components and connections using Computer vision techniques to create a semi-automatic recognition system

In this study, the developer tackled one of the most challenging part of designing routine of electronic engineers. This solution not only helps them to save a huge amount of time allocated for implementation of circuits on applications but also prevents unwanted errors made by humans. A challenging part of this work associated with gathering data for training step which demands to use geometrical transformations. In training phase, two architectures are used, YOLO v3& YOLO v4 which are based on darknet architecture. The obtained outcome from evaluation section shows YOLO v4 performs considerably better than YOLO v3. Therefore, it was used in remaining steps of this work. Furthermore, the evaluation results demonstrate how our solution could classify and detect an object within images. Subsequently, the application part was the key role to achieve our expectations for component detection on real world data. As future development, we can add more data for each class and use YOLO algorithm with an attention mechanism to increase the efficiency of output model which performed weak outcome in some classes of understudy dataset. Furthermore, we can increase the number of classes in order to scale up the number of elements detected by the system. Finally, this work was accomplished to develop a semi-automatic system for the digitalization of hand-written circuits.
